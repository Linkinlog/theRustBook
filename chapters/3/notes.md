# Chapter 3 - Common Programming Concepts

### Synopsis
This chapter mainly goes over programming concepts and how they work in rust. Variables, basic types, control flow, etc. [Reserved keywords](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/appendix-01-keywords.html).

### Variables and Mutability
- Variables are immutable by default of course
- Constants are actually constant
    - Can be declared in any scope incl. global
    - must be set to a constant, not a result
    - Should be all uppercase and underscore-case

### Data Types
- Scalar and compound
- Inferred well until its not and then we need to annotate the types
#### Scalar
- Single value
- Ints, floats, bools, chars
-
